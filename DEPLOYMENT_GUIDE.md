# 🚀 Medical Web Application - Deployment Guide

## ❌ Why Netlify Won't Work

**Netlify is for static sites only** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Your ASP.NET Core medical application is a **server-side application** that needs:
- A .NET runtime environment
- Database connections
- Server-side processing (Razor Pages)
- Session management

## ✅ Recommended Hosting Platforms

### 1. **Railway** (Easiest - Recommended)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Deploy
railway login
railway deploy
```
- ✅ Supports .NET 8.0
- ✅ Automatic PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Domain & SSL included
- 💰 Free tier available

### 2. **Azure App Service** (Microsoft's platform)
- ✅ Native .NET support
- ✅ PostgreSQL integration
- ✅ GitHub deployment
- 💰 Free tier: F1 plan

### 3. **Render** (Developer-friendly)
- ✅ .NET 8.0 support
- ✅ PostgreSQL add-on
- ✅ Git-based deployment

## 🏥 What You Have Built

Your medical web application includes:
- ✅ Patient registration system
- ✅ Database with Neon PostgreSQL
- ✅ Entity Framework Core
